The personal information entered, is stored in the local storage of the browser and is not shared with any third party organization or application. The code is open sourced.

SHOULD I NOT TRUST PASSWORD METER AVAILABLE AT WEBSITE’S SIGNUP PAGE?
- A lot of sites implement the password meter just for the sake of it. They impose the rule of having mix of upper case letter, lower case letter, symbols and numbers and minimum length of 6-8 characters. But just following these rules doesn’t make your password strong. For example, pattern “P@ssw0rd” follows all these rules and many of the websites says it’s a strong password. But in reality it’s a very weak password.
